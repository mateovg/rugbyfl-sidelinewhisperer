# Sideline Whisperer Project

Little project for fun and learning.

# Rugby Predictor Web Application Project Plan

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] Create a new GitLab repository for your Rugby Predictor project
- [x] Set up a virtual environment for Python
- [x] Initialize a Flask project for the backend
- [x] Create a new React project for the frontend using Create React App or Vite

## 2. Backend Development (Flask)
- [ ] Design and implement RESTful API structure
- [ ] Create models for teams, players, matches, and predictions
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for all models
- [ ] Add authentication using JWT tokens
- [ ] Implement a web scraping module to gather rugby match data from local Florida sources
- [ ] Develop a machine learning model for match prediction (use scikit-learn or TensorFlow)
- [ ] Create an API endpoint for match predictions
- [ ] Implement websockets for real-time updates during matches
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests

## 3. Frontend Development (React)
- [ ] Set up the basic structure of your React app
- [ ] Implement state management using Redux Toolkit
- [ ] Create components for:
  - [ ] User registration and login
  - [ ] Dashboard with upcoming matches
  - [ ] Match prediction interface
  - [ ] Leaderboard
  - [ ] User profile
- [ ] Implement real-time updates using web sockets
- [ ] Add data visualization for match statistics and prediction accuracy (use D3.js or Recharts)
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile users
- [ ] Add progressive web app (PWA) functionality

## 4. GitLab CI/CD Setup
- [ ] Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your project root
- [ ] Define stages: build, test, security, deploy
- [ ] Set up jobs for running backend and frontend tests
- [ ] Implement code quality checks using tools like ESLint and Black
- [ ] Add security scanning jobs (e.g., SAST, dependency scanning)
- [ ] Configure jobs for building and deploying both frontend and backend

## 5. AWS Integration
- [ ] Set up an AWS account and configure the CLI
- [ ] Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deploying the Flask backend
- [ ] Set up an RDS instance for your PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Use S3 and CloudFront for hosting and distributing your React frontend
- [ ] Implement AWS Cognito for user authentication and management
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch for logging and monitoring
- [ ] Use AWS SageMaker to deploy and manage your machine learning model

## 6. Data Management and Machine Learning
- [ ] Design a data pipeline for ingesting and processing rugby match data
- [ ] Implement an ETL process using Apache Airflow
- [ ] Develop a machine learning model for predicting match outcomes
- [ ] Use Amazon SageMaker for model training and deployment
- [ ] Implement A/B testing for different prediction models

## 7. Additional Features
- [ ] Implement caching using Redis to improve API performance
- [ ] Add a recommendation system for suggesting matches to users
- [ ] Implement push notifications for match reminders and results
- [ ] Create a chatbot using Amazon Lex for handling user queries
- [ ] Add social sharing features for predictions and results

## 8. Security and Compliance
- [ ] Implement proper data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Ensure GDPR compliance for user data handling
- [ ] Set up AWS WAF to protect against common web exploits
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on your APIs

## 9. Documentation and Portfolio
- [ ] Write comprehensive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
- [ ] Create a detailed README explaining the project architecture
- [ ] Document the machine learning model and its performance metrics
- [ ] Prepare a case study of the project for your portfolio

## 10. Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Perform load testing using tools like Apache JMeter
- [ ] Optimize database queries and add appropriate indexes
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring using AWS X-Ray
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing

## 11. Deployment and Monitoring
- [ ] Set up blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- [ ] Implement auto-scaling for handling traffic spikes
- [ ] Set up alerting for critical errors and performance issues
- [ ] Create a dashboard for monitoring system health and user engagement

## 12. Continuous Learning and Improvement
- [ ] Stay updated with Flask, React, and AWS best practices
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies and address security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Gather user feedback and implement new features
- [ ] Explore possibilities for expanding to other sports or regions
